// Does this module actually load the way Basecamp loads a `ui` plugin?
//
// The prize asks for a GUI "loadable in Logos app (Basecamp)". Shipping a `.lgx`
// is not that claim: Basecamp's PluginLoader has to accept the binary, find the
// interface it compares against, read the metadata, and get a widget back
// through the vtable. When any of those fails it logs one line on stderr — from
// a terminal launch, which a reviewer clicking a tile never sees. The tile is
// simply inert, and nothing says why.
//
// So this drives the same steps, in order, and asserts on each:
//
//   1. The binary loads with every symbol bound, on its own. This module is
//      self-contained on purpose — it names `LogosAPI` only as an opaque
//      pointer type, so it has no undefined host symbols and `RTLD_NOW`
//      succeeds without the host's runtime in the process. A plugin that leans
//      on the host resolves those at load time instead; both designs are
//      legitimate, and the one here is asserted rather than assumed, because
//      "it loaded" means something different in each.
//
//   2. QPluginLoader ACCEPTS it, and REFUSES something that is not a plugin.
//      The refusal is the control: a loader that accepts everything would pass
//      step 2 on a JSON file, and then the acceptance above says nothing. Both
//      directions are asserted for that reason.
//
//   3. The IID it reports is `com.logos.component.IComponent`, which is what
//      the host compares against. A private IID makes `qobject_cast<IComponent*>`
//      return null and Basecamp logs "Plugin does not implement IComponent".
//
//   4. The embedded metadata is this plugin's own: `type` is `ui` (a `core`
//      type is installed into the modules directory, where nothing gives it a
//      window), and `main` names the file that was actually built.
//
//   5. `qobject_cast<IComponent*>` succeeds across the plugin boundary and the
//      vtable is the one the host expects, checked by calling through it:
//      `createWidget(nullptr)` must return a widget and `destroyWidget` must
//      take it back. A null api pointer is the point — the GUI has to come up
//      and say it has no runtime rather than crash the host, because that is
//      what it is handed when anything above it went wrong.
//
// Not asserted: that Basecamp draws it. Nothing headless can assert that.
//
// Run:  ui_plugin_load_test <plugin.dylib|.so> <expected-main-name>
// with QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen where there is no display.
